## About Me
My name is Kimberly Nicole Vito (Kim), and I'm currently a High School Senior interested in the field of Computer Science. What I like to do is code websites and apps, play violin, sing, and feel the presence of the Eucharist. I also love going to Traditional Latin Mass, and this mass helps me calm down, especially when I'm dealing with so many issues in coding. 
Thank you for reading my profile, and hope to see you soon.
