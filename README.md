## About Me
I'm Kimberly Nicole Vito (Kim), and I like to code, make aesthetics, and get inspo from social media. As you all know, I love Joe Biden and support him by coding. I also play violin and piano and do work. I also serve as a cantor at St. Henry's Church, so if you want to check out my singing career, the link is down in the description. Outside of that, I play volleyball and play football.  
Thank you for reading my profile. I hope you like it.
